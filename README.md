# Image_RGB_Manipulation-using-python
This project is to perform RGB Manipulation on an image file of any format using python

Here in this project we open and load a image object, whose RGB values will be stored as a matrix, this is the matrix whose value we will be changing to our needs.

For each color there is 8 bits ie., there will be 24 bits in total for repesenting colors and an additional 8 bits for representing alpha valve(ie., transparency) in the supported formats.
